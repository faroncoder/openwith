THE PROBLEM

When you want to open a file with a program of your choice, you usually
right clicked on the icon in nautilus, browsed the filesystem and choose
your favourite application.

That is not possible anymore with gnome3!



THE (quick & dirty but working) SOLUTION

Simply install the Debian package. Tested in Ubuntu 11.10, Guadalinex v8 and
GECOS v1.

Or:

Copy "openwith" to /usr/bin/ and give it execution permissions

Copy "openwith.desktop" to  /usr/share/applications/ or to your home folder, into
~/.local/share/applications


Finally, open Nautilus, right click on any file, and select "open with another
application" and "Show other applications". From the long list, choose this
new option: "a program of your choice..."
